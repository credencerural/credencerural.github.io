         <h1>Official Statement by Mr. JAMES MURITHI MIRITI</h1>

         <p class="murithi_p">In light of the escalating unemployment rates precipitated by various socio-economic challenges obstructing the pursuit of aspirations, it has become imperative to address this pressing concern. I, <strong>Mr. James Murithi Miriti</strong>, having recognized the gravity of this situation, am driven to establish a Community-Based Organization named "<strong>Credence for Rural Economic and Empowerment Organization - C-free</strong>." This organization serves as the social development arm of <strong>The Credence College Centre</strong>, duly registered within the confines of Kenyan regulatory guidelines.</p>
     
         <p class="murithi_p">The primary objective of C-free is to impart skills to the less fortunate, fostering job creation opportunities and integrating them into contemporary societal trends. This endeavor aims to contribute to <strong>Balanced Economic Growth</strong> and provide <strong>Solutions to Social, Economic, and Political Problems</strong>, recognizing these individuals as the voice of the future.</p>
     
         <p class="murithi_p">Our Mission and Vision are deeply rooted in the thematic framework of the <strong>Second Medium Term Plan of Kenya Vision 2030</strong>, underlining the commitment to "<strong>Transforming Kenya: Pathway to Devolution, Socio-Economic Development, Equity, and National Unity</strong>." This alignment ensures that our efforts resonate with the broader national development agenda.</p>
     
         <p class="murithi_p">Motivated by the belief that everything is possible, I envision a future where the underprivileged can confidently articulate their reasonable and critical thoughts. By nurturing skills development, facilitating networking opportunities, and instilling principles of good leadership, C-free endeavors to empower individuals to actively contribute to conscious growth and development, thereby improving their lives and contributing to the prosperity of our nation.</p>

         <p class="footer">The developments in counties are determined by the process of economic and social transformation that is based on complex cultural and environmental factors and their interactions.</p>
         <p class="footer"><em>Laikipia County</em> is in the ift great valley province of Kenya. It has a population of 399,227 with 103,114 households and covers an area of 9,462 km2. The population density is 42 per km2 and only 46% live below poverty line. Main economic activity apart from tourism is horticulture and mixed farming. The county is prone to climatic shocks and in every 4-5 years there is a major drought. This is a big challenge and has made many families to be dependent on relief aid. Laikipia County hosts the largest number of persons displaced by the 2007/08 PEV. Laikipia County consists of Laikipia East, Laikipia West and Laikipia North Constituencies</p>
         <p class="footer"><em>Meru County</em> forms the larger part of eastern province, Meru County constitutes of at least ten constituencies and as such it is a multi-climatic region, with mainly one tribe occupying more than 95% of the land. The Ameru people practice different lifestyle that ranges from pastoralist at the meru north, crop husbandry and arable farming at the south and mixed farming in central. Over the last few years Meru has experienced unprecedented growth with mushrooming of over ten university academic excellence centres, this is the highest in the Republic and yet majority of the people continue to wallow in the valley of despair and hopelessness due to high poverty rate and low literacy levels. Meru County consists of Imenti South, North Imenti, Central Imenti, Buuri, Tigania East, Tigania West, Igembe North, Igembe South and Igembe Central Constituencies</p>
         <p><em>Nyeri County </em> Nyeri is a city situated in the central highlands of Kenya. It is the county headquarters of Nyeri 
            County. The city population, according to the 2009 Kenya Population and Housing Census, is 
            estimated at 225,357 persons. The largest formal employer in Nyeri, being until recently the 
            administrative headquarters of the former Central Province, is the Government of Kenya. A 
            major industry in Nyeri is farming, which is mostly non-mechanized. The main cash crops are 
            coffee and tea, grown mainly by smallholders who are organized into quasi-private state supported and supervised co-operatives or companies for farm input distribution, basic 
            processing and marketing purposes. The main food crops are maize, the staple food in most of 
            Kenya, legumes (especially beans and peas), tubers (mainly potatoes), and vegetables 
            (especially tomatoes, cabbage, spinach and kale). Livestock, mainly dairy cattle, goats, sheep,
