              <h2 class="section-title">The Challenges Facing Rural Skills Development</h2>
              <p>Skills training in rural areas is confronted with numerous challenges, both financial and non-financial. These hurdles impede the participation of individuals in training programs and include:</p>

              <ul class="prob">
                  <li class="prob"><span class="highlight">Financial Barriers:</span> School fees, high transport costs, and poor infrastructure create financial obstacles to accessing training programs.</li>
                  <li class="prob"><span class="highlight">Non-Financial Barriers:</span> High levels of illiteracy, particularly in marginalized areas, inadequate equipment, and gender roles that discourage women and girls from pursuing education, citing childcare responsibilities.</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p>The challenges facing rural areas are multifaceted, contributing to deficits in job opportunities and hindrances to economic growth. Key challenges include:</p>
          
              <ul class="prob">
                  <li class="prob"><span class="highlight">Job Opportunity Deficits:</span> Severe shortages in job opportunities, exacerbated by the effects of Covid-19 lockdowns.</li>
                  <li class="prob"><span class="highlight">Economic Impacts of Covid-19:</span> The pandemic has led to low rural income and capital, further stressing the already fragile rural economy.</li>
                  <li class="prob"><span class="highlight">Inadequate Infrastructure:</span> Insufficient infrastructure hampers economic activities and development in rural areas.</li>
                  <li class="prob"><span class="highlight">Limited Educational Opportunities:</span> Rural areas often lack educational opportunities, restricting the skill set and knowledge base of the population.</li>
                  <li class="prob"><span class="highlight">Underinvestment:</span> A lack of investment in rural areas hinders their potential for growth and development.</li>
                  <li class="prob"><span class="highlight">Leadership Challenges:</span> Poor leadership and a lack of goodwill pose additional barriers to economic progress.</li>
                  <li class="prob"><span class="highlight">Networking and Communication Barriers:</span> Inadequate networking and communication systems further isolate rural communities from opportunities.</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p>Despite agriculture being the primary economic activity in rural areas, the nature and balance of on-farm and off-farm activities vary across counties. The scarcity of formal wage employment, compounded by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, has led to a decline in self-employment and microenterprises, negatively affecting the informal economy.</p>
          
              <p>Therefore, addressing these challenges and promoting skills development in rural areas requires an integrated response. Your support can contribute to reducing rural poverty and empowering the youth, women, and men in our rural communities. Join us in making a difference today!</p>
